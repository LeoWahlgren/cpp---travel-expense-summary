# cpp---travel-expense-summary

A text-based oop-program where you can create summarys of a trips expenses between a group of friends. Some of the program features are: Load an existing trip from a .txt-file and add new expenses or create a completely new trip, calculate total sum of all expenses, show how much a person has in debt or will get back, write out information about all transactions, list all persons and their payment/debt-status. The result will be saved as .txt-file.

For now, all persons need to both have payed and been payed for in able to write out a full summary of all persons.
